///   Both returned sets are **always non-empty**. If no rule matches,
///   the fallback is `Season.allCases` / `[.casual]` so the picker on
///   the Add Item form never lands on zero selections.

/// The rules themselves live in `RulesTable.swift` — this file just wires
/// the entry point and enforces the non-empty invariant.
